        A combination of inflammatory and hematological markers strongly predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients, as detailed by Parul Chopra et al.(PMID: 37124653) in their study. 
        
        Using the same datset, we have developed a SVM model, with accuracy of predicting survival: 80.1%, Sensitivity of 83.7%, and a specificity of 78.6%. These findings highlight the significance of laboratory markers in early prognostication and patient management.
